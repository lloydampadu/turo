    neighborhood_overview:
      "The apartment is located in the famous district Sch\u00f6neberg between U stations Wittenbergplatz and Nollendorfplatz. In the roaring 1920s, Sch\u00f6neberg was the neighbourhood of artists and musicians of Berlin. The neighbourhood around Nollendorfplatz in particular was known for elaborate parties and a casual lifestyle. To this day, modern clubs like Goya build on the atmosphere of that time. Winterfeldplatz, which hosts the city's largest food market on Wednesdays and Saturdays, lies directly to the south. Around the square and on nearby side streets, there are plenty of cafes and bars. Another Place of interest is Sch\u00f6neberg town hall. After the division of Germany, it was the political centre of West Berlin. This is where Kennedy uttered the famous words, 'ich bin ein Berliner'. To the south of the town hall, the long Rudolf-Wilde park is a good option for a leisurely stroll. Sch\u00f6neberg has a good connection to the neighbouring districts. The U-Bahn lines U1, U2, U3, U4 and U7 go through",
    notes:
      "Marlene Dietrich lived in this original Berlin house from 1894 and the owner of this apartment is a famous Danish musician. Please note! This is not an apartment but a guest room where You have Your own private en suite bathroom and sunroof terrace. The kitchen and the dining room You have to share with Your host. 5th Floor NO elevator!",

    neighborhood_overview:
      "The Kreuzberg area is very up and coming with very many cool and trendy bars in walking distance. It is known for its multi-cultural and liberal vibe. Also the city centre (Mitte) with all the main touristic attractions is quite close and can be easily reached by public transport or a longer walk. There is a supermarket just around the corner. Our street is mainly a residential area, but it's walking distance to some tourist attractions (such as Checkpoint Charlie) and to lively areas such as Oranienstr. and Kottbusser Tor. You can also find many delicious brunch spots around! :)",
    notes:
      "As we work during the week, if you plan to arrive during the day, we might need to arrange for a key pick up. This can be either close to our work or at a caf\u00e9 nearby depending on which one is handier on your journey to the flat. Details can be discussed if needed.",

      "We are very close to Prinzenstrasse (U1) and both Moritzplatz (U8) and Hallesches Tor (U6) are approximately ten minutes away. As Berlin is quite a wide-spread city and attractions are both in the former East and West, getting around by public transport is nearly essential if you want to see most things.",

The Oderberger Strasse is a very lively yet very relaxed street that offers the distinctively bohemian vibe Prenzlauer Berg has been made famous for. Artsy caf\u00e9s, quaint boutiques and laid back restaurants make it a favourite destination of locals and visitors alike.  Neighbourhood highlights include the Kastanienallee with its dozens of bars, restaurants and coffee shops -among which the renowned Prater, Berlin\u2019s oldest beer garden- and the Mauerpark with its very popular Sunday flea market. The entertainment complex of the Kulturbrauerei is just around the corner, as well as the Kollwitzplatz with its fine wining and dining (and, of course, shopping). The not-to-be-missed Berlin Wall Memorial is in the vicinity of the apartments whereas Berlin landmarks such as the TV Tower or the Museum Island are a leisurely stroll.  This is an ideal base for exploring Berlin: rig",

      'PR,  growth marketing, brand development and social media for startups.  I consult a Venture Capital firm, as a business analyst for AI, IoT, hardware, and drone companies. \r\n\r\nLOVES:  vegan/raw foods, travel, oceanside views, warm sunsets, islands in the sun, yachting, a former board-sports girl most of my life (learned to kite board in beautiful South Africa) and filming with GoPro.  \r\n\r\nBerlin has become a metropolitan tech mecca, rich with culture and attracts many international personalities, so I\'m lucky to be surrounded by talented, innovative people.  Always excited to  meet likeminded entrepreneurs, artists/creatives, developers, mathematicians, investors, especially areas of focus like: machine learning, AI, cryptology,  blockchain.  I live a balanced, wellness lifestyle, so I cook mainly fresh, organic, plant based foods.\r\n\r\nI\'m easily reachable and am in regular contact with my guests - we will share the flat.  I invest into experiences more than material things so my flat reflects this minimalistic mindset, but it\'s very clean, really cosy and "incredibly central!" I provide a light breakfast "on request" for my guest, during their stay :)\r\n\r\nIf you are a first time user of Airbnb or do not have references, please tell me a bit about yourself and your reason for visiting Berlin, so that I can ensure you have the most positive experience as a guest in our city and my home. Welcome to our city!',
